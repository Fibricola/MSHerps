Discovery, documentation, monitoring of MS Herpetology specimens for the purpose of publishing a catalog of MS Herp trematodes.

Trematodes of amphibians and reptiles have been collected and reported from Mississippi, but no organized cataloging attempt has been made. Ajoining states of Louisiana and Alabama, including the most western portion of the Florida panhandle, share a large number of herp species. A study by a volunteer parasitologist working with the University of Southern Mississippi's Gulf Coast Research Laboratory has undertaken to consolidate all historical collection records, collect new trematode specimens, and publish a catalog of trematodes from Mississippi, including comparisons to records from Louisiana and Alabama. Alabama is here defined as the State boundaries including the portion of the Florida panhandle connecting to the Alabama border down to the Gulf of Mexico. The phrase in use henceforth for this region will be "AlaFlor".
